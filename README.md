#  Social  Token

This innovative platform aims to provide an invaluable ecosystem where new developers can gain hands-on experience, expand their portfolios, acquire new technical skills, and earn tokens for their contributions.

 Aspiring developers will have the opportunity to work on real-world projects, collaborating with mentors and experienced professionals to accelerate their growth in the tech world. Simultaneously, companies and startups looking to hire promising talent can tap into this rich pool of emerging developers, fostering a vibrant and dynamic marketplace for talent acquisition. With SDT, we envision a future where both newcomers and established organizations thrive in a mutually beneficial ecosystem that fuels the tech industry's growth.

Unlocking Opportunities with SDT:

SDT stands as a symbol of empowerment for budding developers, offering them a platform to kickstart their careers, learn, and earn. Through hands-on projects and mentorship, they can hone their skills, gain practical experience, and build an impressive portfolio, all while earning tokens for their dedication. Employers, on the other hand, can discover and engage with emerging talents who are passionate about contributing to their projects. This platform will be a win-win solution, bridging the gap between fresh talent and tech industry demands, ultimately fostering a collaborative and prosperous community where learning and innovation are the driving forces behind the tech landscape's evolution.

## Technologies
For this project, our technology stack encompasses several key components:

We utilize IPFS-NFTStorage to securely store all user profiles, ratings, portfolios, job information, and reviews as NFTs. This ensures data integrity and reliability.

Our smart contract development relies on Solidity and Hardhat, providing a robust and well-tested foundation for our blockchain operations.

To handle the minting and completion of jobs, we employ the OpenZeppelin ERC721 standard, streamlining our contract functionality. We also utilize the ERC721 template for accelerated smart contract development.

For local blockchain development and testing, we turn to Hardhat, which facilitates efficient and reliable development workflows.

On the frontend, we harness the power of Tailwind, Next.js, and React.js to create an engaging and user-friendly interface. Ethers.js serves as the bridge to connect with the blockchain.

In addition, we incorporate WorldCoin to enhance the functionality of our platform.

To ensure scalability and accessibility across various networks, we leverage The Mantle, Celo, Arbitrum, and Scroll Network for our deployment strategies.

Furthermore, we optimize user interactions by implementing The Graph for efficient querying of our smart contract, delivering an enhanced overall experience for our valued users.
